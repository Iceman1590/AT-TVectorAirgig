Dear Reader, 

If you are reading this, you have our files relating to our work with the Anki Vector Robot for Project Airgig.
In the folder named "Project Files", we have all our work stored as we completed it, some of it makes sense and is completed, some of it not so much, so look at all of it with a grain of salt.
The folder denoted "Apps" holds in it many of the more advanced applications of Vector's various capabilities. In order to use many of these, you will have to install various external libraries. We don't exactly remember which ones to install, so proceed and install accordingly.
The "Tutorials" folder contains sample programs that are useful for starting out with programming Vector himself. In addition to these, there is a page that contains more documentation relating to his features. This page is given by the link below:

Documentation Page: https://developer.anki.com/vector/docs/api.html

The pages we used most are below:
	- https://developer.anki.com/vector/docs/generated/anki_vector.behavior.html
	- https://developer.anki.com/vector/docs/generated/anki_vector.nav_map.html
	- https://developer.anki.com/vector/docs/generated/anki_vector.proximity.html
	- https://developer.anki.com/vector/docs/generated/anki_vector.robot.html
	- https://developer.anki.com/vector/docs/generated/anki_vector.util.html

Finally, our final work towards the Smarter Smart Car System is contained in the "Final Project Material" folder. We made sure we went through and documented all the final work.
